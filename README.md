Hello! You've reached the cradle of my portfolio website. 🎂

As an engineer/designer, I designed and developed the website by myself 👩🏻‍💻 <br/>
(with a little help from [React.js](https://reactjs.org) and other frameworks of course)

* It is suggested to use [Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/intl/en_uk/chrome/) to view the website for maximum compatibility!

## About Me 😊

I am a recent graduate with B.B.A. in Information Management from National Taiwan University in pursuit of humanity via HCI, UX/UI, and Social Computing. I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in the field of HCI to extend my capability and initiate studies/projects with an impactful outreach.

**I aim to promote mental health and emotional wellness with my comprehensive technical skillset, communication skills and a keen perception.** I utilize technology to develop human-computer interactions to alleviate human’s internal suffering.

With my expertise in data science, deep learning, NLP, UX/UI design, graphic design, and business knowledge, I executed projects to help people suffering from anxiety or depression and provided convenient solutions to user frustrations. I also utilized my social skills to act as the team leader, project manager, and presenter in my teams.
